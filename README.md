# FRA_default_prediction

The project is an Indian credit risk(default) model, using the data provided in the
spreadsheet.

Steps:
Dependent variable - We need to create a default variable which should take the value of 1 when net
worth next year is negative & 0 when net worth next year is positive.

Validation Dataset - We need to build the model on train dataset and check the model performance
measures on validation dataset.

A report is also created on the model.
